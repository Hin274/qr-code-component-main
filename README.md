### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```
Code that I used to center the QR code perfectly across device widths
css
.center {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.container {
  width: 20rem;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Layout_cookbook/Center_an_element). This helped me with learning how Flexbox can be powerful tool for responsiveness as I am able to perfectly center the content across different screen widths without repeating my code. As I only knew about using media queries to cater for each device width.
